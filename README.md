# Calendar-Companion
This is a simple app that makes it easier to interface with Google
Calendar for micro-scheduling, which for now I'm simply calling
"Calendar Companion."

Right now it's a pretty rough draft with all sorts of missing features
and bugs, but after working in PyCharm the last couple weeks I thought
it would be exciting to see if I can't get it on my phone!
